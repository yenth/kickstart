### How to create a repo

1. Create repo on Github online
2. Clone the online repo onto local working directory (or pull if you wish)

    git clone URL
    
3. Make changes whatsoever needed for the files/docs/images in the folder on local working directory, save, then add and commit the changes

  git commit -a -m "add short description here"
  
4. Push local directory to the Github online

  git push origin master
  
* It is good to constantly check 'git status' to see the level of changes
